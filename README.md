# Exploratory Data Analysis for Microsoft Studio

##### Author : Nurulain Abdi

## Overview

This project analyzes the types of films that are topping box office movies in terms of income, genre and the length of films to be produced using different data analysis methods to help Microsoft’s team decide what type of films to create.

## Business Problem

Microsoft is a tech company that wants to venture into video content creation and they have decided to create a new movie studio. They may be able to do this after analysing what kind of genres are popular and are income generating.



## Data

Data is from IMDb and Box office mojo which are online databases of information related to films and their gross incomes.

The data used for analysis is:

- imdb title.basics

- imdb.title.ratings

- bom.movie_gross



## Methods

This project uses Exploratory data analysis which cleans the data in preparation for visualisation.
The visualisations give an overview of what kind of film genres Microsoft should produce.

## Results

The most profitable genres are Action,adventure and Sci-fi.

The most popular movies which are measured by ratings is found to also be of the genres Action,adventure and Sci-fi.

I then checked if there is a positive correlation between good ratings and the gross income, which we found to be positively correlated.

## Conclusions

- Based on the analysed data Microsoft should create a genre of films that are adventure, action, sci-fi or comedy. Not only has the data shown that they are the most highly rated but they also the most profitable. It’s a win win really.

- The analysis also shows that more genres that are produced in one movie such as an action,adventure and scifi do better than individual genres.

- Microsoft can also choose to acquire BV studio which is the most profitable  both in locally and internationally.

## Next Steps

Further data analysis could give more insights onto the actual profitability of the movie studio:

- More data that will help do a cost benefit analysis for the actual cost of creating these movies.

-A predictive model to make an analysis on whether Microsoft should acquire the best performing movie studio or stick to starting theirs from scratch.
